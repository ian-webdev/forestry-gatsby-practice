## **3billion Aims for the Global Market by IPO**

3billion, an AI-based rare disease genetic diagnosis startup, aims for the global market by IPO. 3billion has selected Korea Investment & Securities Co. as its representative organizer and is pushing for listing on KOSDAQ, a stock market, and the Korea Exchange trading board. Until now, 3billion has been targeting the global market by advancing AI technology to improve diagnostic performance while significantly reducing the time and cost required. The progress has been capable enough to supply rare disease diagnosis services to 71 hospitals in 24 countries so far.  
Recently, 3billion's business diversification has been underway in various fields. It recently signed a contract with a multinational pharmaceutical company for support for thousands of patient diagnoses. It is currently also discussing supplying genetic diagnostic software for large-scale genome decoding projects in major countries.  
A 3billion official stated, "Based on the large-scale rare disease genomic data obtained from diagnosis, we plan to show the initial results of the AI drug development platform in the second half of next year."
